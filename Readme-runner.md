Control the number of iterations, etc. by modifying num_ant and max_iterations in the AntColonyOptimazation.py.

Suggestion:Depending on the size of the data file. We can relatively reduce the value of parameters.



a280: ant_num=20, max_iterations=100 is okay.

a4461: ant_num=10 or 5, max_iterations=20 . maybe we can try.

a33810:ant_num=5 or 2, max_iterations=5 or 10 . maybe we can try.
