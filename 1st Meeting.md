Meeting No. 1

Group Number : N 
Date: 21st Nov, 2023
Time:  10:30 am to 12pm
Location: Virtual on Microsoft Teams

Attendees:
WILKINSON, Charlie
RAHATAL, Ritesh Sunil
JIN, Hongjin
WANG, Peitao
YUSUF, Najeeb
LIU, Sihang

Discussion Topics:

1. Language discussion: Decided to use Python

2. Designing fitness functions and algorithms for a problem.

Discuss two questions related to the Travelling Thief Problem, including finding the solution and satisfying requirements in different cities.
Discuss designing a fitness function and algorithm for a problem, with some disagreement on the approach.

3. Using Pythagorean theorem for distance calculation in TSP.

Explains how to calculate distances between cities using the Pythagorean Theorem.

4. Solving complex optimization problems using Al.

Propose linking two problems (TSP and NP) to find a solution like using Ant Colony Optimisation(ACO) and pheromones to optimise item placement in a city. 
Suggest conducting research and documenting it before starting work on the fitness function.
Research algorithms for a machine learning problem.
Give details of algorithm which have researched and why use ACO
Look at algorithms before deciding on an approach.
Discuss how to approach research and representation of data to solve a problem.

5. Data for travelling salesmen and knapsack problems.

Explain how to parse data for travelling salesman problems and knapsack problems.

6. Fitness function for optimization algorithm.
Use hyperparameters to balance time and weight in fitness function. 


Work distribution:

1. Research ant optimisation algorithms that can be used to solve the problem, highlighting pros and cons for each one. Special focus on the nature of the problem whereby two different types of problems intertwine
WILKINSON, Charlie
RAHATAL, Ritesh Sunil

2. Write the function that parses the data into the program, special focus on what data structures to use to represent both the travelling salesman part of the problem and the knapsack problem. A data structure that makes it easy to change which location is visited or what items are picked is preferred
  - JIN, Hongjin

  - WANG, Peitao

3. Write the fitness function that takes in the locations visited, the knapsack at each location and returns the final weight of the bag and the total time taken to finish the tour. Special focus will be on maximising the speed of this function, since it will be executed several times
